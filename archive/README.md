## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Debug files** - Used during development, not needed in production
2. **Test files** - Temporary testing scripts, replaced by proper test framework
3. **Old documentation** - Superseded by comprehensive documentation suite
4. **Old submissions** - Earlier versions, final submission is in `submission/`
5. **Experimental code** - Research code that didn't make it to production

## Note

These files are kept for historical reference and may be useful for:
- Understanding the development process
- Learning from past experiments
- Referencing old approaches
- Audit trails

They are not required for running the production code and can be safely deleted if space is a concern.
